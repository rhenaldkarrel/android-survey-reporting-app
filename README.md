# Survey Reporting Android Application

A survey reporting Android application for a loan company. This was for my college research. This application helps the surveyor collect data needed for auditing customers' eligibility before getting loaned. The data could be images, templated forms from the company, and a customer eligibility report form. The features were built based on the related company's needs in my research.

## Highlights

- Built with React Native and Expo
- Implement maps feature for locating customer's location
- Implement a haversine algorithm for location matching between surveyors and customers
- Implement calendar, maps, image upload, persistent login, and many more features
- Built with Native Base UI components
